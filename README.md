# SCEA v1.0 - Smart Contract English Auction Simulation

## Overview

This project is an AnyLogic simulation model named **SCEA v1.0** which stands for Smart Contract English Auction version 1.0. It is designed to simulate and analyze the dynamics of English Auctions within a smart contract framework. The model is built using AnyLogic simulation software and explores various aspects of auction mechanisms, particularly focusing on:

*   **Shill Bidding:** Investigating the impact of shill bidders on auction outcomes.
*   **Shield Mechanisms:**  Analyzing the effectiveness of shield mechanisms in mitigating shill bidding and enhancing auction fairness.

This simulation model is developed for research purposes and allows for experimentation with different auction parameters and bidder strategies.

**Main Project File:**

*   `SCEA v1.0.alp`: This is the primary AnyLogic project file. You will need AnyLogic software (version 8.9.3 or later recommended) to open and run this model.

**Project Folders:**

*   `shield`: This folder likely contains experiments and scenarios specifically designed to test and analyze shield mechanisms within the auction.
*   `Shill Experiment`: This folder probably includes experiments focused on simulating and observing the effects of shill bidding strategies on the auction dynamics.
